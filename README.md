# My first actual Python program

I've always wanted to code. And now I've found a project!
This is just designed to be a simple math program, along with some
miscallenous things (1 for now)

This is a command-line program.

# Feel free to edit this however you like
Push requests, etc are all welcome! I'm looking forward to improving.
